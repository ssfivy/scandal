Scandal Higher Layer Protocol. 
-=-=-=-

This is a release of the UNSW Solar Racing Team's Scandal CAN higher-layer protocol. This protocol has been used for many different electronic projects at the UNSW solar racing team. Some of the highlights inlude an implementation for Tritium's Gold controller, a custom-designed control board for Drivetek's MPPTNG maximum power point tracker, and dozens of sensors and other nodes. 

It was developed by David Snowdon <scandal@snowdon.id.au> as part of his fourth year engineering thesis at the University of New South Wales, but has been contributed to by various other members of the UNSW solar racing team (Bonne Eggleston, Robert Reid, Michael Blennerhassett, Scott McDaid, Etienne Le Sueur).
