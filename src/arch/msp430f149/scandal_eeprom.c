/* Notes on flash programming: 
   David Snowdon, 5/4/2008
   There seems to be a problem in here with the system resetting just after
   a flash operation. It may make it half way through programming, or it 
   may not make it through at all. 
   In either case, we have problems with the flash not being completely
   written. 
   To rectify this, we should a) do checksums and b) go through this code
   again with a fine-toothed comb.
